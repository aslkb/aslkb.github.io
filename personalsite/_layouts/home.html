<!--
  This file overrides the theme's `home` layout to remove the automatic
  posts list that the default theme (minima) injects on the homepage.
  By delegating to `layout: default` and only rendering {{ content }},
  the homepage will no longer include the posts list while preserving
  the same header/footer/structure.
-->
